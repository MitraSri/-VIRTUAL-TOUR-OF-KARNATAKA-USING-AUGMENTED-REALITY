# -VIRTUAL-TOUR-OF-KARNATAKA-USING-AUGMENTED-REALITY
This project presents a virtual tour experience of the Indian state of Karnataka using an augmented reality (AR) camera. Karnataka is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, historical monuments, picturesque landscapes, and diverse wildlife. The aim of this virtual tour is to provide users with an immersive and interactive experience, allowing them to explore Karnataka's prominent landmarks and natural beauty from the comfort of their own homes. 
The virtual tour also includes interactive features, allowing users to engage with the environment. Users can manipulate the AR camera to change viewpoints, zoom in on specific elements, and interact with virtual objects, enhancing their exploration experience. Moreover, social sharing functionalities enable users to capture and share their virtual tour experiences with others, fostering a sense of community and encouraging further exploration of Karnataka. 
Here the app displays two monuments which are Hampi and Gol Gumbaz on top of the Karnataka Map. There are three buttons respected to each monument which are shown and the third button directs to wikipedia page.
The steps are as follows
1. Create Image Target
Image targets in augmented reality (AR) refer to real-world images or pictures that act as triggers for displaying virtual content or augmentations. When an AR camera detects an image target, it recognizes the image and overlays digital content onto it, creating an interactive and immersive experience for the user.This is done with the help of vuforia engine. Vuforia is an augmented reality (AR) platform that provides tools and technologies for creating AR experiences. One of the key components of Vuforia is the Target Manager, which is a web-based portal that allows you to create and manage image targets for your AR applications.
